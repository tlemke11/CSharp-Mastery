Many of the pattern examples here are inspire by the following Lynda Course:

Here are my notes from the course.

Design patterns are proven, generic solutions to common software development problems.


**Design Patterns:**
1. Have flexible, maintainable code.
2. Anticipate changes in the future.
3. Created by the Gang of Four.
4. Allow you to 

Most Common Patterns:
1. Strategy - 
   
   Underlying principle: Encapsulate what varies
   
   Definition: "The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it."
   
   Notes: Strategy is the basis for Composition over inheritance - 
   This means that we use Composition (has-A) when we think that things will change
   and Inheritance(is-A) when we thing that things will not change.
